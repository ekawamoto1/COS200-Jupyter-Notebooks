    "<b>Lists</b> are a type of <b>collection object</b> in Python. They function like arrays in strongly typed languages (Java, C++, C#), but are a bit more general, in that they can hold values that do not have to be of the same data type. List items are indexed, ordered, changeable, and can have non-unique values. Indexed means that elements are referred to by index, or order in the list; the first element has index <code>[0]</code>, the second element has index <code>[1]</code>, and the Nth element has index <code>[N-1]</code>. Ordered means that existing elements of a list have a defined order which will not change as items are appended (added onto the end of the list). Changeable (mutable) means that list elements can be changed, added, or removed after a list has been created. Finally, since each element of a list can be referred to by its index, elements can occur more than once (that is, they can be non-unique). <br>\n",

    "Later, we will revisit the notion of copying objects in more depth. For now, just be aware that the assignment operator (<code>=</code>) does NOT make an independent copy of a mutable (changeable) object such as a list, but instead, simply assigns a new **name** (reference) to the same object. Thus, if you have a list <code>L1</code> whose contents you want to preserve while you operate upon a copy <code>L2</code> of it, that will NOT happen if you create that copy by using <code>L2 = L1</code>. Instead, you will need to make either a <b>shallow</b> or a <b>deep</b> copy of <code>L1</code>, and assign it to the variable <code>L2</code>. At this point, there is no difference between shallow and deep copies of a list, but we will see later that the distinction becomes important when the elements of the list you're copying are themselves mutable objects (e.g., lists of lists, or lists of dictionaries)."

    "Once again, we will revisit the notion of copying objects in more depth. For now, just be aware that the assignment operator (<code>=</code>) does NOT make an independent copy of a mutable object like a dictionary, but instead, simply assigns a new **name** (reference) to the same object. Thus, if you have a dictionary <code>car1</code> whose contents you want to preserve while you operate upon a copy <code>car2</code> of it, that will NOT happen if you create that copy by using <code>car2 = car1</code>. Instead, you will need to make either a <b>shallow</b> or a <b>deep</b> copy of <code>car1</code>, and assign it to the variable <code>car2</code>. At this point, there is no difference between shallow and deep copies of a dictionary, but we will see later that the distinction becomes important when the elements of the dictionary you're copying are themselves mutable objects (e.g., dictionaries of lists, dictionaries of dictionaries, etc.)."
