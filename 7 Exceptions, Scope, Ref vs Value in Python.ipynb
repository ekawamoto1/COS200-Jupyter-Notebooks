    "### Exceptions in Python\n",
    "Errors happen when running code in any programming language. However, some errors are more serious than others - the less serious ones, most of which can be anticipated, are called <b>[exceptions](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/Exceptions/01_intro_exceptions.html)</b>. These can be caught and handled - that is, recovery from some exceptions is possible, and program execution can continue. On the other hand, there are <b>errors</b> that a reasonable application should not be expected to catch or recover from. All errors in Python are dealt with using exceptions, but not all exceptions are errors. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common types of built-in Python exceptions are:\n",
    "* <b>Exception</b> this is a base class for almost all of the following exception subclasses\n",
    "* <b>AttributeError</b> - Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.\n",
    "* <b>IOError</b> - Raised when an I/O operation (such as a print statement, the built-in open() function or a method of a file object) fails for an I/O-related reason, e.g., “file not found” or “disk full”.\n",
    "* <b>ImportError</b> - Raised when an import statement fails to find the module definition or when a from ... import fails to find a name that is to be imported.\n",
    "* <b>IndexError</b> - Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.\n",
    "* <b>KeyError</b> - Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys.\n",
    "* <b>KeyboardInterrupt</b> - Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control-C or Delete).\n",
    "* <b>NameError</b> - Raised when a local or global name is not found.\n",
    "* <b>OSError</b> - Raised when a function returns a system-related error.\n",
    "* <b>SyntaxError</b> - Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error.\n",
    "* <b>TypeError</b> - Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. The associated value is a string giving details about the type mismatch.\n",
    "* <b>ValueError</b> - Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a more precise exception such as IndexError.\n",
    "* <b>ZeroDivisionError</b> - Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>A full list of these can be found at <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/exceptions.html\"><b>https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/exceptions.html</b></a>. Python also provides the ability for the user to create their own custom exception types.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, exceptions are raised (or thrown) when syntactically correct code runs, but is given invalid input (for instance, when functions that take floats are given strings), input values that cause mathematical errors (division by zero, square root of negative numbers, etc.), resources are unavailable (files or devices cannot be found or accessed), the names of variables or objects are not found, and so on. We should distinguish these from syntax errors, which occur when the Python parser cannot interpret a line of code according to the rules of Python syntax. When this occurs, the program will not compile or run, and the parser will return an often cryptic error message that sometimes identifies where the error occurred. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these types of runtime errors can be corrected through user intervention (user can be asked to re-enter information, to connect or provide permissions for accessing resources, etc.),  exception handling provides a mechanism for <b>recovering</b> from them. That is, program execution can continue to completion without having to terminate and restart the program if the exception is properly handled."

    "In testing or debugging code, <b>assertions</b> are useful for detecting errors that might be introduced by making changes to other parts of code. Basically, an assertion is a \"sanity check\" that makes sure that a variable has the value(s) it is expected to have at a certain point in the code. That is, an assertion tests whether a certain condition is true; if it is, then the program may proceed, but if it does not, then an exception will be thrown. In a code base consisting of thousands or millions of lines of code, it is impractical to use <code>print()</code> statements to make such checks; exceptions will be found because code will not execute past the point where the error occurs. <br><br>\n",

    "A <b>namespace</b> is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information about the object that each name references. You can think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the values are the objects themselves. Each key-value pair maps a name to its corresponding object. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of multiple, distinct namespaces means several different instances of a particular (variable) name can exist simultaneously while a Python program runs. As long as each instance is in a different namespace, they’re all maintained separately and won’t interfere with one another. However, suppose that you refer to the name <code>x</code> in your code, but <code>x</code> exists in several namespaces. How does Python know which one you mean? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer lies in the concept of <b>scope</b>. The scope of a name is the region of a program in which that name has meaning. The interpreter determines this at runtime based on where the name definition occurs and where in the code the name is referenced. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike C, C++, and C#, Python and Java do not use <code>namespace</code> as a keyword. Both Python and Java do treat the notion of scope in similar ways, but Java is more \"granular\" in doing so. (That is, Java defines the scope of some variables over smaller blocks of code.) We'll see below how Python handles block-level scope. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the location of the name assignment or definition to associate it with a particular scope. In other words, where you assign or define a name in your code determines the scope or visibility of that name. For example, if you assign a value to a name inside a function, then that name will have a <b>local</b> Python scope. <b>Enclosing</b> (or <b>nonlocal</b>) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions. However, if you assign a value to a name outside of all functions — say, at the top level of a <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-modules/#:~:text=A%20Python%20module%20is%20a,makes%20the%20code%20logically%20organized\"><b>module</b></a> — then that name will have a <b>global</b> Python scope. Finally, <b>built-in</b> scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It’s automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the hierarchy of namespaces is given by the <b>LEGB rule</b>, which stands for $\\text{Local} \\subset \\text{Enclosing} \\subset \\text{Global} \\subset \\text{Built-In}$. The interpreter searches for the name of a variable in this scope order, and raises a <code>NameError</code> exception if it is not found. <br>\n",

    "Below are examples of the behavior of immutable (<code>int</code>) and mutable (<code>list</code>) objects when we *think* we're making a copy of them (perhaps to save their values for some later use) using the <b>assignment</b> operator <code>=</code>, and then changing the value of the original. In Python, we <b>bind</b> names (of variables) to objects in memory (which don't have names before this binding occurs). For other languages like C and C++, we have the notion of a <b>pointer</b>, which is an address of a location in memory where an object('s value) is stored. However, in Python, we need to think of variables and objects as if they were key-value pairs in a dictionary (which they are, as shown when you ran <code>locals()</code> and <code>globals()</code> earlier). <b>Assignment NEVER copies data or makes new values.</b> <br>"

    "In many programming languages, the assignment operator is often used to make a <b>copy</b> of an existing variable (that is, a value stored under the name of an existing variable). For instance, if <code>a = -35.8</code>, then we are used to believing that <code>b = a</code> creates a copy of what is stored at <code>a</code>. However, in Python, this is not quite true. Instead, as mentioned in the previous section (Passing by reference vs. passing by value), the assignment operator NEVER makes copies or makes new values. Instead, the assignment operator <b>binds</b> names to objects in memory. For <b>immutable</b> objects, this does not usually make a difference. We see this below:\n"
