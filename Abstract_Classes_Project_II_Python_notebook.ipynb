    "### Abstract classes in Python\n",
    "An <b>[abstract class](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-classes-in-python/)</b> can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains _one or more_ abstract methods is called an abstract class. An <b>abstract method</b> is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation (that is, it has no body). When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, a <b>[concrete class](https://realpython.com/python-interface/)</b> contains only concrete (normal) methods, whereas abstract classes may contain both concrete methods and abstract methods. A concrete class provides <b>concrete methods</b>, which are implementations of abstract methods. However, as we'll see later, an abstract base class can also provide an implementation of an abstract method, but that method must still be overridden in the derived class.\n"

    "### Why use abstract base classes?\n",
    "By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common Application Program Interface (API) for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially useful in situations where a third party is going to provide implementations, such as with plug-ins, but can also help you when working in a large team or with a large codebase where keeping all classes in your mind is difficult or impossible. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we have what seems to be an abstract class because its only method is declared, but has no implementation. However, the code in <code>main()</code> allows <code>AbstractClass</code> to be instantiated, and its abstract method <code>do_something()</code> can be run (that is, Python does not require us to provide an implementation for this method)."

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "For this project, you are to use what you know about data structures and classes to create a simple two-card poker game for three or more players. In order to do this, you will need to create methods for the <code>Game</code> class that compare two-card hands with each other. The usual rules apply:<br><br>\n",
    "* If cards in both hands are dissimilar, then the hand with the highest card(s) wins. <br>\n",
    "* If one hand has a pair and the other doesn't, then the hand with the pair wins. <br>\n",
    "* If both hands have a pair, then the highest pair wins. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the following: <br>\n",
    "1. Randomize (shuffle) the cards that are dealt to each player <br>\n",
    "2. Print the cards in the deck <br>\n",
    "3. Only allow cards to be dealt if there are enough remaining in the deck <br>\n",
    "4. Print the cards that each player is holding, so you can determine the winner by inspection. (Here, suits don't matter, so you can ignore them.) <br>\n",
    "5. Now, for the hard part: identify the winner(s) of each game according to the rules given above. (This is difficult because you need to account for the possibility of two or more players having the same high card if nobody has a pair, as well as the possibility that two or more players may have a pair, and comparing what they have a pair of.) <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here is a hint that may make your coding easier: use dictionaries to keep track of each player's high card and what they have a pair of. (If a player has no pair, the value associated with this player will be zero.) <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
